# Spotify Web Player | Joyce's Version

This project was created with the aim of showcasing my skills in design front-end development to apply for internships at Spotify. As a big fan of Spotify and their user-friendly interface, I wanted to replicate the features of the Spotify Web Player and mimic the functionality of the original Spotify player to showcase my portfolio & projects.

Similarly with Spotify Web Player, the search feature shows all of my projects. Work leads you to filter through my projects based on Product Design/Product Management, UX Research, and Design Engineering.

Disclaimer: This react app is to showcase my projects. For case studies and more information on specific projects, please go to my [Portfolio site](https://joycejiang.space)
